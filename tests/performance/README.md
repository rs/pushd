Performance testing for pushd
=============================

Simple performance testing setup using HTTP push service:

1. Configuration:
  - Enable http push server in settings.coffee
  - Configure the number and frequency of generated messages by editing settings() method pushgenerator.py
1. Start the pushd server: `node server.js`
1. Start test performance listener: `node statsserver.js`
1. Start traffic generator: `python pushgenerator.py`

Traffic generator
-----------------

*pushgenerator.py* sends push notifications at a configurable rate.

The frequency of notifications and the number of subscribers can be
configured by editing the function settings() in pushgenerator.py.

pushd process is expected be running on localhost on port 5000
(configurable by PUSHD_SERVER variable in pushgenerator.py).

By default, pushgenerator.py creates random HTTP POST subscribers as
the receivers of the notifications. The HTTP push service must be
enabled in pushd's settings.coffee.

Statistics collector
--------------------

*statsserver.js* is a node.js server that can receive HTTP POST
notifications generated by pushgenerator.py and display some
statistics of the received notifications.
